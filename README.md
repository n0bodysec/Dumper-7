# Dumper 7

SDK Generator for all Unreal Engine games. Supported versions are all of UE4 and UE5.

## How to use

- Compile the dll in x64-Release
- Inject the dll into your target game
- The SDK is generated into the path specified by `Settings::SDKGenerationPath`
## Overriding Offsets

- ### Only override any offsets if the generator doesn't find them by itself
- All overrides are made in **Generator::Init()** inside of **Generator.cpp**

- GObjects
  ```cpp
  ObjectArray::Init(/*GObjectsOffset*/, /*ChunkSize*/, /*bIsChunked*/);
  ```
  ```cpp
  /* Make sure only to use types which exist in the sdk (eg. uint8, uint64) */
  InitObjectArrayDecryption([](void* ObjPtr) -> uint8* { return reinterpret_cast<uint8*>(uint64(ObjPtr) ^ 0x8375); });
  ```
- FName::AppendString
  ```cpp
  FName::Init(/*FName::AppendStringOffset*/);
  ```
- ProcessEvent
  ```cpp
  Off::InSDK::InitPE(/*PEIndex*/);
  ```
## Notes

- Be aware, that the calls to ProcessEvent in `Main.cpp` may crash on debug configuration
- Initialize SDK by calling the function `SDK::InitSdk()`
- In the SDK, functions from classes as `UKismetSystemLibrary` or `UGameplayStatics` may only be called on their default-objects
